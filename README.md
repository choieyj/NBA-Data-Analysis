# 🏀 NBA MVP Predictor

This project analyzes NBA player performance across multiple seasons to identify the top 3 MVP candidates each year, based on a custom offensively-biased scoring formula. It emphasizes scoring efficiency, points per game, assists, and rebounds — and compares the model's picks against the actual MVP winners.

---

## 📊 MVP Formula

The MVP score is calculated using the following features:

```
MVP_SCORE = 
    (PTS per game × 2.0) +
    (AST per game × 1.0) +
    (REB per game × 0.5) +
    (FG efficiency × 20)
```

This formula favors offensive efficiency, placing the highest weight on points per game and shooting accuracy. Defensive stats are intentionally excluded.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `web_scrape.py`: Scrapes NBA player stats from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com) for seasons 2013–2024 and saves them to Excel.
- `nba_player_data.xlsx`: Dataset generated by the scraping script.
- `mvp.py`: Loads and processes the data, calculates MVP scores, and visualizes the top 3 MVPs per season alongside actual MVP winners.
- `mvp_graph.png`: Visualization output showing yearly top MVPs with true MVPs highlighted in green.

```bash
python web_scrape.py
```

2. **Run the MVP Analysis and Visualization:**

```bash
python mvp.py
```

## 📌 Notes

- The scraper introduces a random delay between requests to avoid rate-limiting.
- Only **regular season** stats are used in MVP calculations.
- Visualization is generated using `matplotlib`.
